# Web-Scraping-Laptop-Price-Analysis

In this Webscraping Project I have made some analysis on the laptops prices based on their features...

Steps Followed : 
  1.Problem Statement
  
  2.Data Collection 
  3.Data Cleaning/Data Manipulation 
  4.Exploratory Data Analysis

Modules that I have used :
    - beautifulsoup
    - requests
    - regular expression
    - matplotlib
    - seaborn
    - plotly
    
In the Exploratory Data Analysis 
    - Uni variate Analysis : Univariate analysis is the simplest form of analyzing data i.e single variable / column
    - Bi variate Analysis : Analysis on 2 columns
    - Multi variate Analysis : Analysis on more than two columns 

As a conclusion we got to know that most the laptops prices are mostly dependent on the RAM .
